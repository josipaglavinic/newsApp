# Features
- search bar (filtered by the name of the article)
- categories (the possibility to filter articles by category)
- getting data from API

# Design decisions
- The *Latest News* Icon and title in the mobile version was removed, because by clicking on the navigation bar *Latest* it already implies that the latest news are being listed
- When there is no author specified or of unknown origin, *Author unknown* will be shown under the title
- When the article has no picture attacked to it, a grey box containing *No image* will be displayed

# Instalation
- clone repository (https://github.com/josipaglavinic/newsApp)
